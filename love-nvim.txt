Some reasons to love and use vim/nvim

1 - Recording and repeat commands in nvim

I need to delete 4 columns from a sheet

* Press 'q' to start recording
* Press 'd' to assign 
* Press a sequence that you want to repeat, in this case I will jump the collumn(word) with 'W' and delete a collumn(word) with 'dW', jump to next line with 'j' and go to beginning of line '|'.
* Press q to end the recording
* Recall the command with @d or @@ or 5@d

2 - Ident multiple lines

* Enter visual line mode with V 
* select the lines with 'j' or 'k'
* Press '>' to ident

3 - Comment multiple lines

* Before need to install nerdcommenter plugin
* <leader>cc to comment
* <leader>cu uncomment
